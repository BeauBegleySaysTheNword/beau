            <p>Beau Begley (2007-2024)
                Beau Begley passed away unexpectedly on the 1st of may 2024. Details surrounding his death are pending.
                
                Mr. Begley's family and friends are deeply saddened by his loss. Those who knew him well will remember his charity work for suffering gambling addicts.
                
                The family wishes to emphasize that Beau did not hold prejudiced views. The use of racial slurs does not define who he was as a person. They ask for understanding and privacy during this difficult time.
                
                In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to<b> [Charity Ù…Ø±ØªØ¨Ø·Ø© Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ù…Ø³Ø§ÙˆØ§Ø© Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ù‚ÙŠØ©]</b>
                
                Due to the nature of Mr. Begley's passing, the family has chosen to hold a private service.
                
                We offer our sincere condolences to those who knew and loved Beau.
